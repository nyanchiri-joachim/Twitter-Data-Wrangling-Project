# Repository: Twitter Data Wrangling Project

## Description

Welcome to the **Twitter Data Wrangling Project** repository. This project demonstrates the complete data wrangling process, including data gathering, assessment, cleaning, and analysis. The goal is to clean the data related to tweets from the Twitter archive and prepare it for meaningful analysis and visualization. This repository contains all the necessary files, notebooks, and reports to understand and replicate the data wrangling steps.

### Contents

- **README.md**: Provides an overview and description of the repository contents and instructions on how to use the files.
- **a_wrangle_act-checkpoint.ipynb**: Checkpoint version of the main data wrangling and analysis notebook.
- **a_wrangle_act.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the full data wrangling process, including data gathering, assessment, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
- **act_report.html**: An HTML report summarizing the act of cleaning and analyzing the data.
- **image-predictions.tsv**: Contains the predictions of the dog breeds based on the tweet images.
- **tweet_json.txt**: Raw data file in JSON format containing additional tweet metadata.
- **twitter-archive-enhanced.csv**: The enhanced version of the original Twitter archive, including additional features and cleaned data.
- **twitter_archive_master.csv**: The final, cleaned, and master dataset ready for analysis and visualization.
- **wrangle_report.html**: An HTML report documenting the data wrangling steps, including the issues identified and the cleaning process.

### How to Use

1. **Explore the Notebooks**: Open `a_wrangle_act.ipynb` to follow the entire data wrangling process. This notebook includes detailed explanations and code for each step of the process.
2. **Check the Reports**: Review the `act_report.html` and `wrangle_report.html` for summaries of the data wrangling and cleaning activities. These reports provide insights into the challenges faced and the solutions implemented.
3. **Analyze the Data**: Utilize the cleaned data files (`twitter_archive_master.csv` and `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`) for further analysis and visualization. These datasets are prepared and ready for in-depth data analysis tasks.
4. **Review Raw Data**: For a better understanding of the original data, examine `tweet_json.txt` and `image-predictions.tsv`. These files provide the raw data used during the wrangling process.
